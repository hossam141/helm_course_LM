# Packaging and Publishing Helm Charts

## Overview

Welcome! In this session, we're diving into the process of packaging and publishing your Helm charts. While our current Helm chart is quite basic, it sets the foundation for understanding the packaging process. Before we jump into the detailed steps, let's try to implement the solution on your own! Hereâ€™s a brief overview of what you should attempt:

1. Confirm that your Helm chart generates correctly with `helm template`.
2. Ensure your chart passes linting with `helm lint`.
3. Install your Helm chart using `helm install`.
4. Uninstall the previous Helm chart with `helm uninstall`.
5. Package your Helm chart using `helm package`.
6. Verify the versioning in the chart archive.
7. Install the packaged chart using the archive file.
8. Share the packaged chart as a portable artifact.

Give it a shot, and see how far you can go before checking the detailed steps below! ðŸš€

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Confirm the Chart Generation**: Use `helm template` to check that your chart is generated correctly.
2. **Lint Your Chart**: Run `helm lint <path to chart>` to ensure there are no errors (note the suggestion to add an icon, which can be optional).
3. **Install Your Chart**: Execute `helm install local <path to chart>` to deploy your chart, but make sure to uninstall any previous installations first with `helm uninstall`.
4. **Package Your Chart**: Use the command `helm package <path to chart>` to create a versioned chart archive.
5. **Check the Archive**: Locate the `.tgz` file generated, and open `Chart.yaml` to verify the version included in the package.
6. **Repackage if Necessary**: If you change the version in your `Chart.yaml`, run `helm package` again to create a new versioned package.
7. **Install from the Archive**: Finally, install your Helm chart using the command `helm install <release-name> <path to tgz file>`.

## Conclusion

Great job on working through the process of packaging and publishing your Helm chart! Remember, the key steps involve confirming your chartâ€™s integrity, packaging it correctly with the right versioning, and then installing from the created archive. Itâ€™s a powerful way to share your work! Keep practicing, as the more you work with Helm, the more proficient youâ€™ll become.
